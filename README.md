# Indian-UI-Library

## Description:

The project aims to build a standard publicly available Open Source 2D/3D Indian assets UI library for 2D icons and 3D objects for product builders.


## Problem Statement:

There is no standard visual asset library (2D or 3D) for Indian resources available easily on the internet and it makes it a redundant task every time that product builders have to create one from scratch instead of just accessing it easily.


## What qualifies as an Indian asset?

* **Obvious:** An asset that reflects the services, attributes or consumables that are routine part of the Indian way of living instead of borrowed from other demographics.
* **Distinguishable:** An individual should be able to discern unambiguously the relationship of the asset with the Indian culture and demography.
* **Specific:** A generic Indian asset should not be represented through a sub-culture of a niche community within the Indian demography unless the goal of the asset is to represent the culture from the community itself.
* **Localized:** Any asset that is common day to day use in other cultures and probably reflects as a global representation for the purposes of communicating the need but is not part of the Indian culture is not an Indian asset.
* **Relevant:** The asset should adequately represent the purpose relevant in the current space and time and should not be loosely bargained from historical usages unless the purpose of the asset is to specifically depict the historical artefact or culture.
* **Diverse:** The library should not be monocultural, i.e. depicting resources only from 1 predominant culture or beings unless that is the purpose.
* **Ethical:** It should not represent the culture in a derogatory manner or hurtful to the sentiments of that culture.


## Examples of Indian assets

* Food: Dosa and Thali instead of burger
* Places: Indian town is different from a western urban/sub-urban spaces
* Professions: Indian lawyer or policemen are different
* Institutions: Gram panchayat; Indian banks are different and are probably better represented through a vault or a locker instead of pillared building
* Sign Posts: 
* Things: home UPS/Inverter, ATMs, Rupee sign instead of dollar wherever currency is required to be denoted
* Tools and Gadgets: Sewing machine or Lanterns or Gas, pressure cookers
* People: From skin tone to facial characteristics vary from North to South and East to West
* Clothing: Saree is a better Indian representation for clothing than TShirt
* Businesses: Mom and Pop shop in India is better known as Kirana instead and would be possibly better represented as an Indian shop. 
* Art and Music: Music in India is better represented by surs like Sa re ga maâ€¦ instead of staff notations. More common Indian musical instruments are Tabla, Sitar or Harmonium than a guitar or drums
* Vehicle: Trucks, Hand rickshaw, auto rickshaw, boat, Kali Peeli, etc
